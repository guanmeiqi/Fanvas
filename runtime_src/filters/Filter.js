 * Base class that all filters should inherit from. Filters need to be applied to objects that have been cached using
 * the {{#crossLink "DisplayObject/cache"}}{{/crossLink}} method. If an object changes, please cache it again, or use
 * {{#crossLink "DisplayObject/updateCache"}}{{/crossLink}}. Note that the filters must be applied before caching.
 *
 * Note that each filter can implement a {{#crossLink "Filter/getBounds"}}{{/crossLink}} method, which returns the
 * margins that need to be applied in order to fully display the filter. For example, the {{#crossLink "BlurFilter"}}{{/crossLink}}
 * will cause an object to feather outwards, resulting in a margin around the shape.
 *
 * <h4>EaselJS Filters</h4>
 * EaselJS comes with a number of pre-built filters. Note that individual filters are not compiled into the minified
 * version of EaselJS. To use them, you must include them manually in the HTML.
 * <ul><li>{{#crossLink "AlphaMapFilter"}}{{/crossLink}} : Map a greyscale image to the alpha channel of a display object</li>
 *      <li>{{#crossLink "AlphaMaskFilter"}}{{/crossLink}}: Map an image's alpha channel to the alpha channel of a display object</li>
 *      <li>{{#crossLink "BlurFilter"}}{{/crossLink}}: Apply vertical and horizontal blur to a display object</li>
 *      <li>{{#crossLink "ColorFilter"}}{{/crossLink}}: Color transform a display object</li>
 *      <li>{{#crossLink "ColorMatrixFilter"}}{{/crossLink}}: Transform an image using a {{#crossLink "ColorMatrix"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>
